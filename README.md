## üìå About This Project

ThreatFeed HQ is an RSS feed aggregator that collects security-related news and advisories from multiple sources and posts them to designated Discord channels via webhooks. The script ensures:

- Automated retrieval of RSS feeds at a defined interval.
- Chronological sorting of news entries before posting.
- Posting to a global Discord channel and specific vendor-based channels.
- Prevention of duplicate postings via persistent tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Support for multiple RSS feeds (e.g., Sophos, Cisco, etc.)
- Posting to Discord webhooks in structured format
- Duplicate detection using persistent JSON storage
- Configurable polling intervals and webhook endpoints
- Logging for debugging and monitoring
